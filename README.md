# veracodetest
test for VeraCode
To run:
1. change (or leave as it is) URL in veracodeUrlTest.txt
change path to this txt file on line 24 of URLValidationTest.java
2. run/compile JUnit class URLValidatioTest in Eclipse with Java1.6 compatibility level or run from cmd line

Comment: code, as I believe, can be improved significantly with Java1.7 by use of Scanner class, Apache package URL validation, etc.
Unfortunately Mac OSX (my home notebook) has significant issues with two Java versions installed simultaneously 
- and I am currently working on maintaining the project with Java1.6.
